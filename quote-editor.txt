Turbo Rails Tutorial
Chapter 0 - https://www.hotrails.dev/turbo-rails

1. Let's create our brand new Rails application. We will use Sass as a CSS pre-processor to create our design system, esbuild to bundle our single line of JavaScript, and a Postgresql database to be able to deploy our app on Heroku at the end of the tutorial.

$ rails new quote-editor --css=sass --javascript=esbuild --database=postgresql

2. As this tutorial was written at the time of Rails 7.0.0 let's make sure we use the version of turbo-rails that was used at the time to avoid unexpected issues. Let's update our Gemfile by locking the turbo-rails version:

# Gemfile
gem "turbo-rails", "~> 1.0"

3. We can now run bundle install to install the correct version of the gem.
$ bundle install

4. Now that our application is ready, let's type the bin/setup command to install the dependencies 
and create the database:
$ bin/setup

5. We can now run the rails server, and the scripts that precompile the CSS and the JavaScript code with the bin/dev command:
$ bin/dev

6. We can now go to http://localhost:3000, and we should see the Rails boot screen.
