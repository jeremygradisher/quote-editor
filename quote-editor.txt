Turbo Rails Tutorial

1. Let's create our brand new Rails application. We will use Sass as a CSS pre-processor to create our design system, esbuild to bundle our single line of JavaScript, and a Postgresql database to be able to deploy our app on Heroku at the end of the tutorial.

$ rails new quote-editor --css=sass --javascript=esbuild --database=postgresql


2. As this tutorial was written at the time of Rails 7.0.0 let's make sure we use the version of turbo-rails that was used at the time to avoid unexpected issues. Let's update our Gemfile by locking the turbo-rails version:

# Gemfile
gem "turbo-rails", "~> 1.0"
